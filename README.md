## 📦 Assets & Media Files
Due to **GitHub repository size limits**, the **full assets folder (images, videos, high-resolution media)** is **not fully included** in this repository.

Only essential placeholders and references are kept here so the structure remains clear.

### 🔐 Request Full Assets
If you need access to the **complete assets folder** (for review, collaboration, or academic purposes), feel free to contact me:

📧 **neo.monserrat@gmail.com**

I’ll be happy to provide access.
