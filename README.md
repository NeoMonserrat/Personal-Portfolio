# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.  
It showcases my background, projects, and contact information, built with a clean and minimal front-end stack.

## 🌐 Live Purpose
The website serves as:
- A personal portfolio
- A project showcase (academic & personal work)
- A central contact point for collaborations and opportunities

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **Google Fonts (Inter)**

No frameworks or build tools are required.

---

## 📦 Assets & Media Handling (Cloudinary CDN)

To keep this repository lightweight and within **GitHub size limits**, **large media assets** (images, galleries, high-resolution photos, and videos) are **not stored directly in the repo**.

Instead, this project uses **Cloudinary** as a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** to host and serve media assets efficiently.

### Why Cloudinary?
- 🚀 Fast global delivery via CDN  
- 📦 Keeps the GitHub repository small and clean  
- 🔧 Automatic image optimization (`q_auto`, `f_auto`)  
- 📱 Responsive image sizing support  

Media files are dynamically loaded at runtime using Cloudinary URLs defined in the JavaScript layer.

> The repository still includes placeholders and references so the project structure remains clear and easy to understand.

## 🔐 Access to Original / Local Assets
If you need access to the **original local assets** (raw images, videos, or uncompressed media used during development) for **review, collaboration, or academic purposes**, feel free to reach out:

📧 **neo.monserrat@gmail.com**

I’ll be happy to provide access when appropriate.
